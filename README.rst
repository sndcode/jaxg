XNA Platformer Level Editor is exactly what it sounds like, an editor for your platformer! It's fully compatible with the default XNA 4.0 Platformer Starter Kit and includes an unmodified version of it in the download. The Editor was built with simplicity in mind to give you a very basic Editor that you can improve/expand upon to suit your needs for your current game. Currently supports the following features:

* Open and Save .txt files (the format used for each level)
* Paint/Erase/Fill tools so you can quickly change the appearance of your levels without editing them by hand
* Tiles are displayed as images so you can easily see what you're editing with.

To get the Editor up and running with your own platformer-based game there's a couple of articles on the `Wiki page`_ to help get you started.
If you have any questions/comments/suggestions/improvements feel free to let me know on Twitter `@FinalMirage`_ or email me at JeffBrown (at) RobotFootGames (.com).
